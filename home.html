        The rise of the Sultanate of Malacca
        around the year 1400 AD is generally thought to have been the
        beginning of <b>Malaysian</b> history. At its peak, the Sultanate
        controlled an extensive portion of Peninsular Malaysia's and
        Sumatra's East Coast. Malacca's development into a significant
        governmental entity was made possible by its strategic importance
        as an intersection connecting East Asia and the Middle East. This
        position positioned Malacca as a significant trade hub for Southeast
        Asian trade, particularly in spices. Islam became the most popular
        religion among the people as a result of the ruler's adoption of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>Portuguese</b> seized Malacca in 1511,
        beginning in the colonial era in the Malaya region.
        The Dutch then took it in 1641, and the British took over in 1824
        thanks to the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. The colonization by the British
        lasted the longest. They centralized the administration, which had
        traditionally been run by the Malay kings with the help of local
        royalty, which enraged the people of the region. Although there were
        some attempts at colonial resistance, they were usually disconnected
        and ineffective. These initiatives were led by notable individuals
        including <b> Dol Said, Tok Janggut, Datuk Bahaman, Rentap,
            Dato Maharajalela, Rosli Dobi</b>, and others.

    <!-- Story for this event if any-->

    <p>
        Growing numbers of people in Malaya obtained education in the local
        area as well as from the Middle East during the 1920s and 1930s.
        This educated group started promoting nationalism and used media
        like newspapers and magazines to spread their ideas. Some people
        founded organizations with the aim of removing foreign rulers and
        establishing their own government, such as Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM)
        and Kesatuan Melayu Singapura (KMS). As hopes for freedom rose,
        the Japanese invaded Malaya in late 1941, forcing yet another age
        of colonization. Before ending in 1945 as a result of the
        bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese rule remained for a
        while.

    <p>
        The fight of Malayan nationalists gained new energy with the rise of
        Tunku Abdul Rahman. The Alliance Party, founded by Tunku, forced the
        British to accept the need for self-government. The London Agreement,
        which was signed on February 8, 1956, signaled the culmination of
        Malays, Chinese, and Indian unity and stated that Malaya would
        become independent on August 31, 1957. Upon his arrival home from
        London on February 20, 1956, Tunku Abdul Rahman Al-haj announced
        Malaya's independence. Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Alhaj suggested the
        creation of a new country on May 27, 1961, by combining Malaya,
        Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei.
